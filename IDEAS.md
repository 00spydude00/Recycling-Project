# IDEAS

##### BtG system

The idea here is that I could charge cities small amounts of money for maintenance, and advertize to their residents, which would in turn reduce the cost of recycling because people recycle the right things.

Each city could have an account where they can update their own information without first prompting me or making me do research.

I make money from the cities, cities save money from informed residents, residents get a hassle free experience for free with no ads. Win-win-win.

##### Mobile app

The app could use builtin cameras and image recognition to allow people to simply hold their camera up to the thing they want to recycle, and get a result.

It could also use location services instead of users inputting their city manually.

Training and maintaining an ML model would be very expensive, though. Far outside the budget of an 18 year old high school student saving for college.
