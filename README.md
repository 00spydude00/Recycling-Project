# Recycling-Project

This project is (going to be) a webtool based on Flask, Python, and HTML that accesses a json file containing information about each city's recyclables.

I am making this project primarily because it is an absolute pain to know what is recyclable in your city. Just getting the information for this project was very difficult.
Cities frequently have websites with very limited or vague information about what is recyclable. For example, in a perfect world, the orem city official page for recycling in the city would include that they can recycle any of the 7 resin types, but the site only has a long and overwhelming list of every possible material someone might want to recycle.
The worst part is: every single website is completely unique.

I hope to make this a lot simpler. Do you see a 1 in the middle of a recycling symbol? It is recyclable in these cities.

The scope has been limited to only utah county for now, but could be expanded later. As I have already explained, it is very hard to find this information.

For now I have omitted a proper DB for simplicity's sake. I mostly just want to get an MVP out asap.
